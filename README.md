# reading-list

[My reading list since January 1996](https://github.com/jamietr1/reading-list/blob/master/reading.txt). Commits include comments on what I read beginning in June 2015. This list is a simple text file. Here is what you need to know to interpret the list:

* There is one book per line.
* Each line is in the format TITLE by AUTHOR (COMPLETION DATE)
* The following symbols may follow the TITLE:
  * \* = Recommended
  * \+ = E-book
  * @ = Audiobook
  * ^ = Re-read

## Comments on the books I've read

Beginning in late June 2015, I will add brief comments on the books that I've read. I will do this in the commit comment when I check-in the file. To see my comments on a book, view the [master commit log](https://github.com/jamietr1/reading-list/commits/master).

## History and background

I began keeping the list of books I've read back in January 1996. The list has had a variety of forms over the years, but had pretty much been available online the entire time. It has seen form as HTML, and as part of MySQL database. Over time, I've found that the easiest way to maintain the list is as a plain text file stored on Dropbox.
